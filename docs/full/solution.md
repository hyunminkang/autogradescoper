# Preparing the Solution Files

The solution files are typically located in the `solution/` directory, with the filename specified in the `config/config.yaml` file. If you turn on `--skip-solution` option in the `run_autograder` script, the solution files will not be needed.

For example, if `filename` in the configuration file is `mypexp`, the solution file should exist at `solution/mypexp.R` in the Autograder file.
