# Welcome to autogradescoper documentation

This is the documentation for the `autogradescoper` toolkit. 

## What is autogradescoper?

`autogradescoper` is a software package that help instructors to 
create autograded programming assignments for students using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Currently, `autogradescoper` supports a specific type of R programming assignments. 

## How is autogradescoper different from other related tools?

There are other tools that help instructors to create autograded programming assignments using Gradescope.
The [Gradescoper Autograder Documentation](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} provides a language-agnostic guide to creating autograded programming assignments for Gradescope. Several generic examples were provided for [Python](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/){:target="_blank"} and [Java](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/java/){:target="_blank"}. However, there is no specific example for R programming assignments.

The [gradeR](https://github.com/tbrown122387/gradeR){:target="_blank"} package is a tool that helps instructors to create autograded R programming assignments for Gradescope. However, the `gradeR` package is not sufficient enough to create an autograder for Gradescope. It requires additional setup from a user who very well understand how Gradescope autograding system works.

The `autogradescoper` toolkit is designed for instructors who want to create autograded R programming assignments for Gradescope without the need to completely understand the Gradescope autograding system. 
The instructors can follow the step-by-step guide provided in this documentation to create autograded R programming assignments for Gradescope.

## Future of autogradescoper

Currently, `autogradescoper` supports a specific type of R programming assignments. 
Future developments may allow us to support other programming languages or assignment types.
