# Welcome to Autogradescoper Documentation

This is the official documentation for the `autogradescoper` toolkit.

## What is Autogradescoper?

`autogradescoper` is a software package designed to help instructors create autograded programming assignments for students using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/){:target="_blank"}. Currently, it supports a specific type of R programming assignments.

## How is Autogradescoper Different from Other Tools?

Several tools assist instructors in creating autograded programming assignments for Gradescope. The [Gradescope Autograder Documentation](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} offers a language-agnostic guide with examples for [Python](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/){:target="_blank"} and [Java](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/java/){:target="_blank"}, but lacks specific examples for R programming.

The [gradeR](https://github.com/tbrown122387/gradeR){:target="_blank"} package helps create autograded R programming assignments for Gradescope but requires a deep understanding of the Gradescope autograding system.

`autogradescoper` simplifies this process for instructors by providing a step-by-step guide to create autograded R programming assignments for Gradescope without needing extensive knowledge of the Gradescope autograding system.

## Future of Autogradescoper

Currently, `autogradescoper` supports a specific type of R programming assignments. Future developments may expand support to other programming languages or assignment types. If you are interested in contributing, please visit the [Development](development.md) section.
